This includes community colleges, universities, masters, PhD and undergraduate programs. Alternatively, you may be enrolled in an accredited non-U.S. university, but you must have a valid work visa that enables you to work in the United States (we are not able to sponsor you for a visa or provide travel expenses for travel to the U.S.). If you are accepted into or enrolled in a college or university program in mid-April 2018, when we announce the fellows, you are eligible to apply for the the program, even if you will graduate during the program. You must be available to work at the Azavea office in Philadelphia starting on June 1, 2018.

Azavea may ask you to provide transcripts or other documentation from your accredited institution as proof of enrollment or admission status. You do not need to be in a Geography, GIS, or Computer Science program in order to apply, but strong software engineering skills are expected.
